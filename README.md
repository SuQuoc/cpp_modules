# cpp_modules
This is a repository of the 42 cpp modules 00 to 09. It contains my approach to solve the modules and shows my journney learning C++. 
In which i learned among other things:
- polymorphism
- object oriented programing
- stl container 

Notes:
- every module must comply with the C++98 standard
- containers as well as the algorithm library are only allowed in module 08 and 09
